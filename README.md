***Problem Statement***

Atliq Grands, a well-established entity in India's hotel industry, is currently facing competition and a decline in revenue. To address these issues,the management team has chosen to leverage data and strategic insights. Lacking internal data expertise,they have enlisted external assistance to analyze the situation,provide actionable insights, and devise effective strategies for customer retention and revenue growth.

***Project Goal***

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the hotel domain using Python. By employing data-driven insights and strategic recommendations, my aim is to empower Atliq Grands to make informed decisions and regain a competitive edge in the industry.

***Project Highlights***

ðŸ“Š I discovered that Presidential rooms had the highest occupancy, while Standard rooms lagged behind. Delhi topped the occupancy charts, whereas Mumbai generated the highest revenue.

+ Interestingly, weekends outperformed weekdays in terms of occupancyâ€”suggesting strong potential for weekend-specific offers.

 Based on the insights, I recommended actionable steps:

+ Increase online presence to reach wider audiences.

+ Offer city-specific promotions (like discounts in Bangalore and targeted ads in Delhi).

+ Focus on premium offerings during weekends.
